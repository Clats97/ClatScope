### ClatScope Mini

ClatScope Mini is a streamlined variant of the comprehensive ClatScope Info Tool, offering immediate functionality without the need for API keys. Released on May 18, 2025, it is ideal for quick, out-of-the-box OSINT operations, but does not have many of the sophisticated OSINT functions the full version has. 

### ClatScope Info Tool Overview

ClatScope Info Tool is an advanced OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) utility designed for investigators, cybersecurity professionals, and anyone conducting thorough online reconnaissance. This sophisticated tool integrates multiple external APIs (including Perplexity, Have I Been Pwned, Hunter, Hudson Rock, Castrick, Predicta, RapidAPI) to provide detailed intelligence on IP addresses, domains, emails, phone numbers, usernames, personal data, password security, data breaches, and more.

### Subscription Service

To access the full functionality without the hassle of individual API setup, a subscription-based service is available starting January 12, 2024. Subscribers receive a customized script pre-equipped with secured API keys. These scripts track IP addresses, user agents, usage, and access details to safeguard against misuse or unauthorized sharing. Violations or VPN usage, which leads to impossible travel detections, will lead to immediate revocation.

WAAP and Cloudflare API Security protect all API keys. Subscriptions last 30 days, with monthly key rotation to maintain security. For details or subscription inquiries, contact: [skyline92x@pm.me](mailto:skyline92x@pm.me).
